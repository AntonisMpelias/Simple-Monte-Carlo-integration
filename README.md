**Estimating integrals using the Monte Carlo method**
---
 - For a mathematical function f(x), the program estimates the integral's value from point a to point b.
 - After the estimation is done it shows a convergence graph, clearly demonstrating the estimated value approaching the
   actual value of the integral.

   (It doesn't work with integrals that approach infinity)
